# Here in Debian, this file is sourced by:
#   - /etc/init.d/docker (sysvinit)
#   - /etc/init/docker (upstart)
#   - systemd's docker.service

# Use of this file for configuring your Docker daemon is discouraged.

# The recommended alternative is "/etc/docker/daemon.json", as described in:
#   https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd/#daemon-configuration-file

# If that does not suit your needs, try a systemd drop-in file, as described in:
#   https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/systemd/
